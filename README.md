# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
# Desciption
  
I had to make a Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game. For the game to work I used JavaScipt, HTML and CSS. I also utilized my classmates,Google, and my instructor. HTML code is used for id tags and class elements for the game. CSS is used to personalize the game. JavaScript is used to make the game interactive. 

# Getting Started 

I first did a Wireframe.cc to map out how I wanted my game to look the link is below.  Next I did Pseudo Code. I wrote everything I needed to do and what mistakes I have been doing prior to make sure I look over my work frequently for mistakes. I knew I needed my basics done for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# My Hurdles

I had tons of hurdles but I will point out my top three. I had trouble getting my grid to show. I asked my classmate's to help and she was very helpful. She showed me where I went wrong and it was a simple changing the font size. I know the font size. I lauged at myself. I also had trouble seeing my x's and o's. My code was so weird. So I scratched all the code I had for those functions and started over. Once I did that, I was able to see my mistake and fix the problem. Lastely, my winning messages weren't showing up how I wanted them to. I had to add some more code to ge that working right. These top three hurdles took up majority of my time creating the game. I know I'm a beginner but I wanted to add a few silver feature's in my game and wanted to make sure I met all the requirements for the projects. 

# How Does The Game Work 

My game works like any normal Tic-Tac-Toe game except its Atlanta Falcons colors (loyal fan since 1998). The X player goes first, then O. The first letter to get three X's or O's 3 in a row in any combination win's the game. The next screen will congratulate the winner and you can restart the game.
