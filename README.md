# Tic-Tac-Toe Atlanta Falcon Style 
# Desciption
  
I had to make a Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game. For the game to work I used JavaScipt, HTML and CSS. I also utilized my classmates,Google, and my instructor. HTML code is used for id tags and class elements for the game. CSS is used to personalize the game. JavaScript is used to make the game interactive.

# Getting Started 

I first did a Wireframe.cc to map out how I wanted my game to look that link is the planning portion of my read me.  Next I did Pseudo Code. I wrote everything I needed to do and what mistakes I have been doing prior to make sure I look over my work frequently for mistakes. I knew I needed my basics done for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A few screenshots of how the game works, and link to the game are below. Also copy and paste the link into your mobile device to play as well!

# My Hurdles and WIN 

I had tons of hurdles but I will point out my top three. I had trouble getting my grid to show. I asked my classmate's to help and she was very helpful. She showed me where I went wrong and it was a simple changing the font size. I know the font size. I lauged at myself. I also had trouble seeing my x's and o's. My code was so weird. So I scratched all the code I had for those functions and started over. Once I did that, I was able to see my mistake and fix the problem. Lastely, my winning messages weren't showing up how I wanted them to. I had to add some more code to ge that working right. These top three hurdles took up majority of my time creating the game. I know I'm a beginner but I wanted to add a few silver feature's in my game and wanted to make sure I met all the requirements for the projects. The win for me was actually understanding what I was coding and what I was debugging.

# How Does The Game Work 

My game works like any normal Tic-Tac-Toe game except its Atlanta Falcon colors (loyal fan since 1998). The X player goes first, then O. The first letter to get three X's or O's 3 in a row in any combination win's the game. The next screen will congratulate the winner and you can restart the game. 

# What Did I Learn

I learned that if I actually slow down and look at what I'am doing, I can debug and figure out a lot of problems. I also learned how to correctly ask Google the right questions. I also learned that when I'm pushed to my limits I can still perform. I learned a lot this project week these where my top three.
